## Description

* This is a project to apply learned javascript skills to create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with some exceptions:.   Below are the specs for the project:
    1. The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain consonants or vowels.
      * Example Input: 3
      * Example Output: 3
    2. The program adds "ay" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel.
      * Example Input: i
      * Example Output: iay
    3. The program adds "way" to words that begin with a vowel.
      * Example Input: apple
      * Example Output: appleway
    4. The program will treat the letter "y" like a consonant when it begins a word.
      * Example Input: yoyo
      * Example Output: oyoyay
    5. The program moves the first consecutive consonants to the end of the word and adds "ay" to words that begin with one or more consonants.
      * Example Input: banana
      * Example Output: ananabay
    6. The program moves "qu" to the end of the word as if they were a consonant if they are included in the first consonants of the word.
      * Example Input: squeal
      * Example output: ealsquay
